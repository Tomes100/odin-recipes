<h1>Lasagna recipe</h1>
<img src="Images/OIP.jpeg" alt="Lasagna">
<p>Lasagna (US: /ləˈzɑːnjə/, also UK: /ləˈzænjə/,[1] Italian: [laˈzaɲɲa] also known as lasagne, Italian: [laˈzaɲɲe]) is
    a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types,[2] made of very wide, flat sheets. Either term can also refer to
    an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato
    sauce), béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan), and seasonings
    and spices.[3] The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted during baking. Typically cooked pasta
    is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting baked pasta is cut into
    single-serving square or rectangular portions.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>For the meat sauce</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
    <li>1 pound Italian sausage (mild or spicy)</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes</li>
</ul>
<h3>To assemble the lasagna</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 pound mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Put pasta water on to boil:</li>
    <p>Put a large pot of salted water (1 tablespoon of salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat. It can take a while for a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta water), so prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.</p>
    <li>Brown the ground beef</li>
    <p>In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high heat. Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides.</p>
    <p>Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain off all but a tablespoon of fat.</p>
    <li>Cook the bell pepper, onions, and garlic; add back the beef</li>
    <p>Add the diced bell pepper and onions to the skillet (in the photo we are using yellow bell pepper and red onions).</p>
    <li>Make the sauce:</li>
    <p>Transfer the beef mixture to a medium-sized (3- to 4-quart) pot. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste to the pot.</p>
    <li>Boil and drain the lasagna noodles:</li>
    <p>By now the salted water you started heating in step one should be boiling. Add the dry lasagna noodles and cook them to al dente, per package directions. (Note noodles may be cooked in advance.)</p>
    <li>Preheat ht oven</li>
    <li>Assemble the lasagna:</li>
    <p>In a 9x13-inch casserole or lasagna dish, ladle a cup of sauce and spread it over the bottom of the dish. Arrange one layer of lasagna noodles lengthwise (about 3 long noodles, the edges may overlap, depending on your pan) over the sauce. Ladle a third of the remaining sauce over the noodles.</p>
    <li>Bake</li>
    <p>Cover the lasagna pan with aluminum foil, tented slightly so it doesn't touch the noodles or sauce). Bake at 375°F for 45 minutes. Uncover in the last 10 minutes if you'd like more of a crusty top or edges.</p>
    <li>Cool and serve</li>
    <p>Allow the lasagna to cool for at least 15 before serving. Leftovers will keep for about 5 days. You can reheat it in a conventional oven or microwave. Leave the aluminum tent on for storage. (Try to keep the aluminum foil from touching the sauce.)</p>
</ol>
